  Laboratory results are grouped and summarized using the DiagnosticReport
  resource which typically reference Observation resource(s). Each Observation
  resource represents an individual laboratory test and result value or
  component result values, or a “nested” panel (such as a microbial
  susceptibility panel) which references other observations. They can also be
  presented in report form or as free text. This profile sets minimum
  expectations for the DiagnosticReport resource to record, search and fetch
  laboratory results associated with a patient. It identifies which core
  elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets SHALL be present in the
  resource when using this profile.
